You need to create one MongoDB database with one collection called "category".
Design a single collection schema in a manner that we can manage the n-level of category and subcategory with the same collection.
Every category(each record) can have an n-level of subcategory.
Create below APIs in expressJs with MongoDB database
1)Create a category and subcategory with the same collection
2)Update Category
3)Delete category 
4)List categories API with pagination and search
Notes: Use MongoDB atlas for creating a database
